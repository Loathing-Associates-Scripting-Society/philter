/**
 * @file Rollup configuration for building Philter's relay API script
 * (Written in JavaScript to avoid an extra compilation step)
 *
 * This script imports build constants from @philter/common, which is a native
 * ESM package.
 * Unfortunately, Rollup transpiles the config file from ESM to CJS before
 * running it. The transpiled code (CJS) attempts to load @philter/common using
 * require(), which fails because Node.js disallows loading ESM from CJS.
 *
 * ## Solution 1
 * Prevent Rollup from transpiling the config file before passing it to Node.js.
 * As of Rollup v2.44.0, the only way to do so is to:
 *
 * 1. Use the `.mjs` file extension for the config file.
 *    This is not ideal because TypeScript's compiler refuses to type-check .mjs
 *    files, meaning that we cannot automate type checks for our build config.
 *    Thankfully, VS Code still type-checks .mjs files.
 * 2. Use Node.js >= 13.
 *    Note that this is an arbitrary restriction imposed on by Rollup. Although
 *    Node.js >= 12.17.0 can resolve `.mjs` files without a CLI flag, Rollup
 *    does not know this.
 *
 * (See: https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#using-untranspiled-config-files)
 *
 * ## Solution 2
 * Alternatively, we can directly import the ESM code from @philter/common using
 * a relative path. This allows Rollup to transpile the ESM.
 *
 * This allows us to keep the `.js` extension, and support Node.js v12.
 * This is the hack will use until Node.js v12 reaches EOL or Rollup provides
 * better native ESM support.
